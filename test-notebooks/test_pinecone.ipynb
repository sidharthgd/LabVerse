      "• Spell out abbreviations at first mention in tables or add an abbreviations footnote, even if the abbreviation has already been defined in the text. The reader should be able to understand the table content without referring back to the text.\n",
      "• To highlight individual values in tables, you may use boldface type, italic type, or underlining. Any highlighting must have a supplemental note of explanation; attach the note symbol to the first value that is so highlighted. Do not use color or shading.\n",

The asterisks *, **, and *** are always used in this order to show statistical significance at the 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 probability levels, respectively, and cannot be used for other notes. Significance at other levels is designated by an alternate symbol (e.g., a dagger; see also Table 4–1).
